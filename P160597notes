A-rawdata
bam files here generated by HTG
mapped using bwa to the basic hs37d5 reference genome
as an example, for 201249 83% of reads are mapped and 17% unmapped

B-mapped
unmapped reads contain the unmapped reads following mapping by HTG
the bam files in the main directory have been mapped (by me) using bwa-mem to the more extended GRCh38 reference genome which contains the alternate sequences
now 99.51% maps to the human genome
note, because I used the -M option, this also includes supplementary alignments which means that the total number of reads is greater than in the HTG bam files
